- Compiling and Running the Program
    - The command used to compile pingpong.c was 
        - gcc pingpong.c -o pingpong 
    - To then run the program the following command was used
        - ./pingpong # (where # is the desired limit for the program)
            -note that the program will exit if more than or less than 1 argument i given

- Assumptions
    - That the limit for pingpong.c should be reached and written to the file before the process teriminates rather than reach and then not written. Basically the difference between < and <= where I assumped that we should use <=. 

- Known Errors 
    - None known
