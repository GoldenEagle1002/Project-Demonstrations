# Project-Demonstrations

I created this repository to copy over and store many of my previous projects. 

This was needed because many of my old group projects are in private repositories, and the indvidual ones aren't on GitHub. 

So far 3 projects are in shown in this repository 
- Covert_Channel 
    - A prototype covert channel my two groupmates and I worked on during my last internship
- Fork_Project 
    - An assignment that handles forking and process management from my operating systems class
- Simulation_Project 
    - A project where my group partner and I worked to extend a large drone delivery simulation repostiory with additional features. 

More information is in each projects README files

- Note none of the material here is copyrighted or lisensend. The part of the simulation project's repository that we did not create we were told that we could use for job and grad school applications.
